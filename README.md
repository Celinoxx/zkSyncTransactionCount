# zkSyncTransactionCount Script

This is a script that will help you track your transactions on ZkSync for a large number of addresses (helps my farmers out there)

USAGE :

Replace addresses=("#ADDRESS1" "#ADDRESS2" "#ADDRESS3" "#ADDRESSX" ) by your addresses addresses=("0x123456" "0x123456" "0x123456" "0x123456")

It will output the result in a CSV file, so that viewing your results is much more easier
